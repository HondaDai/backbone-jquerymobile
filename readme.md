A sample application that shows how to combine [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) (for the application structure and “routing”) and [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) (for its styles and widgets).

This sample application is documented [here]( http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/03/using-backbone-js-with-jquery-mobile)
